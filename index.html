      Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown food preparation of Theobroma cacao seeds, 
      roasted and ground. It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. The earliest evidence of use traces to the Olmecs (Mexico), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating to 1900 BC.
      <h2>History</h2>
      Chocolate has been prepared as a drink for nearly all of its history. For example, one vessel found at an Olmec archaeological site on the Gulf Coast of Veracruz, Mexico, dates chocolate's preparation by pre-Olmec peoples as early as 1750 BC. On the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico, a Mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cacao beverages dating even earlier, to 1900 BC. The residues and the kind of vessel in which they were found indicate the initial use of cacao was not simply as a beverage, but the white pulp around the cacao beans was likely used as a source of fermentable sugars for an alcoholic drink.
      <h2>Types</h2>
      <h3>DARK CHOCOLATE</h3>
      <p>Dark chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and chocolate liquor. Chocolate liquor is not what chocolatinis are made of -- chocolate liquor is the term for the liquid created by grinding up the center of cocoa beans.
      This type of chocolate can range in cocoa percentages. A higher percentage of cocoa indicates that the chocolate will be more pure and likely less sweet.</p>
      <h3>MILK CHOCOLATE</h3>
      <p>Milk chocolate is the most common type of chocolate, since many people long for the creaminess of milk chocolate. Milk chocolate must be made up of at least 12% chocolate liquor in order to be considered milk chocolate. Try milk chocolate combined with many different flavors with our Milk Chocolate Assorted Boxes!</p>
      <h3>WHITE CHOCOLATE</h3>
      <p>White chocolate is made of cocoa butter, but it does not contain any cocoa solids. Instead, this type of chocolate contains only the fatty part -- the cocoa butter -- as well as milk and sugar.
      Though white chocolateâ€™s legitimacy as a true type of chocolate is heavily disputed, your love of white chocolate can be very real. Some of our favorite white chocolate truffles include our Lemon Truffle and Lemon Raspberry Truffle because white chocolate goes really well with nice fruity or citrus flavors!</p>
